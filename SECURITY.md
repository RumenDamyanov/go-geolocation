## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

To report a security vulnerability, please email [security@rumenx.com](mailto:security@rumenx.com)
instead of using the public issue tracker.

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Upon receiving a security
vulnerability report, we will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. Investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. Work on a fix and coordinate disclosure
4. Provide updates on our progress

Please include the following information in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities
and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.
